# HR Attrition Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes the key factors influencing employee attrition using a fictional dataset provided by IBM Data Scientists( https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset ) .The goal is to uncover patterns and provide actionable recommendations to help organizations reduce turnover rates.

## 📊 Tools & Technologies Used
- **Power BI** (for data visualization and dashboard creation)
- **MySQL** (for data cleaning and analysis)

## 🎯 Objectives
The analysis focuses on three key areas:
1. **Demographic Analysis** – Examining attrition trends based on age, gender, location, and marital status.
2. **Job & Experience Analysis** – Understanding how job roles, satisfaction, and tenure impact attrition.
3. **Salary & Performance Analysis** – Evaluating how salary, promotions, and job levels affect employee turnover.

## 🛠 Data Cleaning
- No duplicate rows or null values were found.
- Ensured consistent formatting across 36 dataset columns.
